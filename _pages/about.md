Hello, and welcome to my personal website! I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology. My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in artificial intelligence, and I am excited about the endless possibilities this field offers.

Beyond academics, I am an avid football enthusiast. Playing football is not just a hobby for me; itâ€™s a way to unwind and stay active. Whether it's on the field or in a team project, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with others to achieve common goals.

Looking ahead, I am eager to pursue higher education, where I can further expand my knowledge and skills in AI. My collaborative spirit and passion for learning drive me to seek new opportunities and challenges, and I am excited about the future that lies ahead.
